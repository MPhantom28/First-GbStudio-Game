Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have worked on the game making such as the tile creation for the game map (I used others assets but made sure its credited), trying to learn the GB Studio features, making the character move, making it able to make the character change from one scene to another. Learning to use the painting / color palette feature (so far only how to change the MC color and black background), worked on thinking what characters and mobs are needed. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

menu, inventory, combat system, start screen, dialogue, many other game scenes / tile maps undone

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

so far I am troubled with the start screen and the other undone things for the project.
