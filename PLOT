ADVENTURES OF THE AQUATERRIAN KNIGHT

PROLOGUE:
THERE WAS ONCE A KINGDOM IN NORTHERN EUROPE THAT LIVED IN HARMONY. EVERYTHING HAD BEEN THIS WAY FOR CENTURIES. NEARLY ALL EVENTS UNFOLDED PEACEFULLY AND IN WAYS THAT BENEFITED EVERYONE INVOLVED. THE SUCCESS OF THIS SOCIETY HAD EVEN REACHED ALLIANCES WITH MANY OTHER CIVILIZATIONS (THIS WAS OUTSTANDING SINCE THE ONLY HUMANS WERE HERE, WHILE ALL THE OTHERS WERE HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL INSECTS). 


PLOT:
THIS WAS ALL UNTIL ONE NIGHT, WHEN ONLY TIRED GUARDSMEN WERE LEFT TO SECURE GOLDANOR'S TERRITORY, AN EVIL LITTLE ROACH NAMED ROCHIE BROKE IN THROUGH A SMALL CRACK ON THE WAL SURROUNDING. HE GATHERED INTEL ON THE MILITARY'S HEAVY TRAINING, THE QUIET ADQUISITION OF WEAPONRY, AND PLANS TO SEND MASSIVE HUMAN PRESENCE SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THEIR BORDERS. ROCHIE USED THIS INFORMATION TO CONVINCE HIS KING, SIR. COCKROACHUS III, THAT GOLDANOR WAS SECRETLY GOING TO BETRAY THERI ALLIANCE AND CONQUER ALL THE INSECT KINGDOMS. (ROACHIE'S MOTIVE WAS THAT HE WANTED TO GET REVENGE ON THE KING BECAUSE YEARS AGO, HIS CONVOY HAD RAN OVER A SMALL INSECT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE HIS TEACHER, WHO TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING HE NEEDED KNOW TO SURVIVE OUT THERE). SIR COCKROACHUS IMMEDIATELY SEND MESSENGERS TO GATHER ALL THE OTHER INSECT KINGS TO DISCUSS THE SITUATUON. THEY EVENTUALLY AGREED ON WORKING TOGETHER AGAINST GOLDANOR. THEY ATTEACKED GOLDANOR WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECTED IT. FAST FORWARD A FEW MONTHS AHEAD AND THE COSTANT BATTLES AND WAR HAD EXHAUSTED ALL SIDES TO THE POINT WHERE THEY BEGAN RUNNING OUT OF OPTION. THE ONLY REASON WHY GOLDANOR WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE AGAINST SO MANY FOR SO LONG WAS THEY VERY LARGE SUPPLY OF ARMAMAMENTS AND MANPOWER, BUT EVEN THEN, RESOURCES WERE RUNNING OUT. THIS IS WHEN THE KING OF GOLDANOR, ALAN GOLDENBANE, REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD ONE SOLDIER IN PARTICULAR THAT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT. HIS NAME WAS ETHAN KNIGHT AND THE ONLY WAY TO KILL HIM WAS BY FREEZING HIS HEART. THE OPPOSING ARMIES DID NOT HAVE ANY MEANS TO DO SUCH THING, SO KING ALAN SENT HIM. 

ONE DAY, THE TWO ARMIES MET FACE TO FACE(ALL THE INSECTS' KINGDOM'S ARMIES COMBINED AGAINST GOLDANORS'), KING ALAN, WHO WAS IN THE FORNTLINES, SENT ALAN TO FIGHT 1V1 STYLE AGAINST THE INSECTS' STEONGEST SOLDIER, INSECTICIDE.
