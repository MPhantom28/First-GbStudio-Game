ADVENTURES OF THE AQUATERRIAN KNIGHT

PROLOGUE:
THERE WAS ONCE A KINGDOM IN NORTHERN EUROPE THAT LIVED IN HARMONY. EVERYTHING HAD BEEN THIS WAY FOR CENTURIES. NEARLY ALL EVENTS UNFOLDED PEACEFULLY AND IN WAYS THAT BENEFITED EVERYONE INVOLVED. THE SUCCESS OF THIS SOCIETY HAD EVEN REACHED ALLIANCES WITH MANY OTHER CIVILIZATIONS (THIS WAS OUTSTANDING SINCE ONLY HUMANS WERE HERE, WHILE ALL THE OTHERS WERE HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL INSECTS). 


PLOT:
THIS WAS ALL UNTIL ONE NIGHT WHEN ONLY TIRED GUARDSMEN WERE LEFT TO SECURE ENTRY TO GOLDANOR'S TERRITORY, AN EVIL LITTLE ROACH NAMED ROACHIE BROKE IN THROUGH A SMALL CRACK IN THE WALL SURROUNDING. HE GATHERED INTEL ON THE MILITARY'S HEAVY TRAINING, THE QUIET ACQUISITION OF WEAPONRY, AND PLANS TO SEND MASSIVE HUMAN PRESENCE SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THEIR BORDERS. ROCHIE USED THIS INFORMATION TO CONVINCE HIS KING, SIR. COCKROACHUS III, THAT GOLDANOR WAS SECRETLY GOING TO BETRAY THEIR ALLIANCE AND CONQUER ALL THE INSECT KINGDOMS. (ROACHIE'S MOTIVE WAS THAT HE WANTED TO GET REVENGE ON THE KING BECAUSE YEARS AGO, HIS CONVOY HAD RUN OVER A SMALL INSECT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE HIS TEACHER, WHO TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING HE NEEDED TO KNOW TO SURVIVE OUT THERE). SIR COCKROACHES IMMEDIATELY SENT MESSENGERS TO GATHER ALL THE OTHER INSECT KINGS TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION. THEY EVENTUALLY AGREED ON WORKING TOGETHER AGAINST GOLDANOR. THEY ATTACKED GOLDANOR WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECTED IT. FAST FORWARD A FEW MONTHS AHEAD AND THE CONSTANT BATTLES AND WAR HAD EXHAUSTED ALL SIDES TO THE POINT WHERE THEY BEGAN RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS. THE ONLY REASON WHY GOLDANOR WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE AGAINST SO MANY FOR SO LONG WAS THE VERY LARGE SUPPLY OF ARMAMENTS AND MANPOWER, BUT EVEN THEN, RESOURCES WERE RUNNING OUT. THIS IS WHEN THE KING OF GOLDANOR, ALAN GOLDENBANE, REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD ONE SOLDIER IN PARTICULAR THAT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT. HIS NAME WAS ETHAN KNIGHT AND HE HAD MADE A GREAT NAME FOR HIMSELF FOR MANY YEARS. HE WAS THE GREATEST FIGHTER ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN AND THE ONLY WAY TO KILL HIM WAS BY FREEZING HIS HEART. THE OPPOSING ARMIES DID NOT HAVE ANY MEANS TO DO SUCH THING, SO KING ALAN SENT HIM. 

ONE DAY, AFTER MOTHS OF CHAOS AND UNNECESSARY SUFFERING, THE TWO ARMIES MET FACE TO FACE(ALL THE INSECTS' KINGDOM'S ARMIES COMBINED AGAINST GOLDANORS'), KING ALAN, WHO WAS ON THE FRONTLINES, SENT ETHAN TO FIGHT  AGAINST THE INSECTS' STRONGEST SOLDIER, INSECTICIDE. 


EPILOGUE:

ETHAN WALKED TOWARD THE INSECT ARMY, THE STONES ON THE GROUND JUMPED UP AND DOWN. HE REFUSED TO LOWER HIS SIGHT FROM THE FACES OF EVERY LEADER AND COMMANDER WITHIN THE INSECT ARMIES. SIR COCKROACHES AND THE DUKE OF FLIES ASKED FOR TWO SOLDIERS, ONE FROM EACH OF THEIR KINGDOMS, TO FIGHT ETHAN. NO ONE DARED TO EVEN CONSIDER DOING SO. TO AVOID SHOWING A LACK OF AUTHORITY AND POWER, THE TWO INSECT KINGS TOOK A FEW STEPS FORWARD AND DECIDED THAT THEY WOULD FIGHT ETHAN TOGETHER. 
AFTER A BRIEF BUT LEGENDARY CLASH BETWEEN ETHAN AND THE COMBINED MIGHT OF SIR COCKROACHUS AND THE DUKE OF FLIES, THE BATTLEFIELD FELL SILENT. AS THE DUST SETTLED AND THE COMBATANTS CAUGHT THEIR BREATH, A MOMENT OF REALIZATION DAWNED UPON THEM. IN THE FACE OF UNEXPECTED ODDS, ETHAN'S SILENT MESSAGE OF PEACE PREVAILED.

WITH WEARY HEARTS AND NEWFOUND RESPECT, SIR COCKROACHUS AND THE DUKE OF FLIES LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS. THEIR INITIAL HOSTILITY GAVE WAY TO A SHARED UNDERSTANDING, AND TOGETHER WITH ETHAN, THEY EMBRACED THE VISION OF A UNITED FUTURE. UNDER THE GOLDEN RAYS OF THE RISING SUN, THEIR DIFFERENCES SET ASIDE IN FAVOR OF COOPERATION.

IN THIS TURN OF EVENTS, THE LANDS OF NORTHERN EUROPE BORE WITNESS TO AN EVENT OF RECONCILIATION. AS THE ECHOES OF BATTLE FADED, THE PROMISE OF ALLIANCE AND PEACE ILLUMINATED THE HORIZON, CASTING ASIDE THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST AND HERALDING A FUTURE FILLED WITH BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITY.



NARRATOR (PROLOGUE BEFORE DIALOGUE FOR CONTEXT):

THERE WAS ONCE A KINGDOM IN NORTHERN EUROPE THAT LIVED IN HARMONY. EVERYTHING HAD BEEN THIS WAY FOR CENTURIES. NEARLY ALL EVENTS UNFOLDED PEACEFULLY AND IN WAYS THAT BENEFITED EVERYONE INVOLVED. THE SUCCESS OF THIS SOCIETY HAD EVEN REACHED ALLIANCES WITH MANY OTHER CIVILIZATIONS (THIS WAS OUTSTANDING SINCE ONLY HUMANS WERE HERE, WHILE ALL THE OTHERS WERE HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL INSECTS).



DIALOGUE: ((FIRST PART))

KING GOLDENBANE: GOOD NIGHT MY DEAR KINGDOM!

GUARDS: HAVE AN OUTSTANDING NIGHT, YOUR MAJESTY.

ROACHIE (APPROACHING THE CRACK AND TALKING TO HIMSELF): YOU'VE ALMOST REACHED THE BEGINNING OF YOUR REVENGE, ROACHIE! JUST A LITTLE FURTHER.

GUARD 1: LONG DAY, AIN'T IT?

GUARD 2: SURELY MY FRIEND, ONE MORE NIGHT AND WE'RE ON OUR EARNED MONTH-LONG BREAK.

GUARD 1 (YAWNING): HARD TO GET USED TO.

(THE CITY NEVER RESTS, SO EVEN AT NIGHT, YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUNDS OF MERCHANTS, LOCKSMITHS, FARMERS, AND MANY OTHERS PREPARING FOR THE NEXT DAY)

(AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER, BOTH WERE KEPT AWAKE BY THE NOISE)

ROACHIE (HIS ANTENNAE HAD STARTED TWITCHING AS HE GOT CLOSER): ALMOST THERE! THESE HUMANS WILL PAY FOR KILLING MY MASTER!

(ROACHIE'S STEPS MAKE A CRUNCHY NOISE ON THE LEAVES)

GUARD 1: DID YOU HEAR THAT?

GUARD 2: PROBABLY JUST AN ANIMAL ROAMING AROUND. LET'S STAY AWAKE AND KEEP ALERT.

(ROACHIE FROZE AND HELD HIS BREATH FOR A FEW SECONDS)

ROACHIE: ALRIGHT, IN THROUGH THE WALL, COLLECT THE INTEL I NEED TO BRING GOLDANOR DOWN, AND OUT I AM.

SERVANT (PASSING BY): ANOTHER LATE NIGHT... I NEED TO SEE THE KIDS

ROACHIE (AS HE QUICKLY RUNS TO THE SHADOWS): I MUST NOT BE CAUGHT.

ROACHIE: ALMOST THERE.

(HERE, ROACHIE REACHES AN AIR DUCT IN THE CEILING AND FINDS THE TOP MILITARY COMMANDER SPEAKING WITH HIS PEOPLE, HE TAKES OUT HIS VERY TINY NOTEPAD AND WRITES EVERYTHING HE HEARS)

ROACHIE (AS HE LEAVES): THIS WILL CERTAINLY CONVINCE MY KING, SIR COCKROACHUS III, THAT GOLDANOR IS COMMITTING TREASON!


((SECOND PART))

(SIR COCKROACHUS III SITS ON HIS THRONE IMPATIENTLY WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION ON THE RUMORS ROACHIE HAD SPREAD ABOUT GOLDANOR)

SIR: WHERE ARE THE MESSENGERS? I DEMAND ANSWERS! 

MESSENGER (RUNS INTO THE ROOM): YOUR MAJESTY! GOLDANOR IS ONTO SOMETHING SINISTER!

(THIS WAS ALL BASED ON WHAT ROACHIE HAS CLAIMED)

SIR (WITH SUSPICION): WHAT?! EXPLAIN YOURSELF!

MESSENGER: MY KING! IT SEEMS THAT GOLDANOR HAS QUIETLY BEEN GATHERING WEAPONRY, TRAINING SOLDIERS, AND AMASSING FORCES. THEY MUST BE PREPARING FOR AN ENORMOUS MILITARY ACTION THAT GOES FAR BEYOND THEIR BORDERS. THEY MIGHT BETRAY OUR ALLIANCE AND TRY TO CONQUER THE INSECT KINGDOMS. 

SIR (SHIVERING WITH RAGE): BETRAYAL?! HOW DARE THEY?! AFTER EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE FOR EACH OTHER! WE MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST THIS THREAT!

(A WEEK LATER, SIR COCKROACHUS III ADDRESSES OTHER INSECT LEADERS)

SIR: MY FELLOW RULERS, IT IS WITH MY DEEPEST REGRET THAT I MUST INFORM YOU THAT WE HAVE BEEN BETRAYED BY OUR SO-CALLED ALLY, GOLDANOR. 

(THE INSECT LEADERS MURMUR AMONGST THEMSELVES)

DUKE OF FLIES (CLENCHING HIS TINY FISTS): HOW COULD THEY?!

LADY BEETLE: THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! WE MUST USE FORCE BEFORE THEY DO.

SIR: ALTHOUGH I AGREE WITH YOU, I MUST MAKE CLEAR THAT WE WILL ACT CALMLY AND PRUDENTLY. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS AN UNFIXABLE MISTAKE. WE WILL DO WHAT WE MUST DO, NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

(AFTER WEEKS OF HEAVY PLANNING)

SIR: THE TIME HAS COME. WE SHALL STRIKE GOLDANOR. 

DUKE OF FLIES (AND THE OTHER LEADERS): WE WILL GATHER OUR ARMIES AND INFORM YOU WHEN WE ARE READY.

SIR (TO HIS COMMANDERS): GATHER OUR VERY BEST SOLDIERS AND PREPARE THEM FOR TONIGHT.

(THE INITIAL ATTACKS HAD BEEN EFFECTIVE BUT GOLDANOR'S DEFENSE SYSTEMS HAD PROVEN TO BE MUCH STRONGER THAN EXPECTED, SO THIS WAR HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS BY NOW)

NARRATOR:  DESPITE MONTHS OF RELENTLESS ATTACKS, GOLDANOR REMAINED STANDING, ITS DEFENSES BOLSTERED BY AN ABUNDANCE OF SUPPLIES AND RESOURCES.

(THE KING OF GOLDANOR, ALAN GOLDENBANE, AMID ALL THE CHAOS AND RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS, REMEMBERED THAT THEY HAD THIS ONE SPECIAL SOLDIER WHO LIKED TO GO UNNOTICED. HIS NAME WAS ETHAN KNIGHT AND HE HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF DUE TO HIS GREAT FIGHTING ABILITIES AND SINGLE WEAKNESS: FREEZING HIS HEART)

GOLDENBANE (ADDRESSING HIS TOP COMMANDERS): WE HAVE USED UP EVERY STRATEGY AND TACTIC BY NOW. OUR RESOURCES ARE RUNNING LOWER THAN EVER AND OUR SOLDIERS ARE EXHAUSTED! THE INSECT ARMIES ARE OVERPOWERING US. WE MUST DO SOMETHING, AND NOW!

(A VOICE IS HEARD LOUDLY): YOUR MAJESTY, WHAT WILL WE DO?

GOLDENBANE: THERE IS THIS ONE SOLDIER... HIS NAME IS ETHAN KNIGHT. HE HAS NEVER EVER LET ME OR THE KINGDOM DOWN. HE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT. HE IS INDEED, OUR LAST HOPE.

THE MAN WHO ASKED: ETHAN KNIGHT? NO ONE HAS HEARD OF HIM FOR MONTHS. IS HE EVEN ALIVE?

GOLDENBANE: SEND SCOUTS TO FIND HIM! SEARCH EVERY SINGLE CORNER OF OUR KINGDOM. HE IS OUR LAST CHANCE.

(A WEEK AFTER, FOLLOWING A LONG SEARCH WITHIN THE KINGDOM OF GOLDANOR, ETHAN WAS FINALLY FOUND)

SCOUT: YOUR MAJESTY! WE FOUND ETHAN KNIGHT!

GOLDENBANE: ETHAN! MY FRIEND! WE FINALLY MEET AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. I'M SORRY TO ASK, BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP, DESPERATELY.

KNIGHT: I HAVE RETIRED FROM FIGHTING ALAN. THERE IS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME TO DO IN THIS WORLD OF ENDLESS CONFLICT. 

GOLDENBANE: ETHAN, OUR GOLDANOR IS ON THE BRINK OF BEING LOST. THERE WILL BE NO VICTORY WITHOUT YOU. 

KNIGHT: ALL THIS TIME ALAN. I AM NOW STARTING TO REMEMBER THE REASONS WHY I FOUGHT SO MUCH FOR GOLDANOR. 

GOLDENBANE: LET'S DO THIS FOR PEACE, MY DEAR FRIEND. IF WE SUCCEED, WHICH WE WILL WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL END THIS UNNECESSARY VIOLENCE AND SET THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW ERA OF BILATERAL COOPERATION, PROTECTION, AND UNDERSTANDING.

KNIGHT: VERY WELL ALAN. I WILL DO THIS FOR GOLDANOR, FOR A MUCH BRIGHTER FUTURE.

GOLDENBANE: THANK YOU ETHAN KNIGHT. TOGETHER WE WILL CREATE A LEGACY THAT WILL BE WRITTEN DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS FOR THE FUTURE AGES.


((THIRD PART))

(BATTLEFIELD, AMIDST CHAOS AND EXHAUSTION)

GOLDENBANE: ETHAN, IT IS TIME. MOVE FORWARD AND END THIS.

KNIGHT: AS YOU COMMAND, MY KING.

SIR: SINCE NOBODY DARES TO FIGHT ETHAN, ME AND DUKE OF FLIES WILL DO SO. DO YOU HEAR THAT, ETHAN!?

DUKE OF FLIES: UNTIL THE END!

ETHAN: SO BE IT.

NARRATOR: AS THE SOUND OF STEEL ECHOED AL THROUGHOUT THE BATTLEFIELD, ETHAN FOUGHT BOTH INSECT LEADERS WITH MUCH SKILL AND DETERMINATION. HIT AFTER HIT, HE MOVED FORWARD. BUT AS THE FIGHT WENT ON, ARE DEEP REALIZATION GOT THE HOLD OF THEM ALL. THE DESIRE FOR PEACE AND PROSPERITY WAS MUCH STRONGER. THIS WAR WAS SENSELESS SINCE NONE OF THE LEADERS FROM EITHER SIDE HAD EVEN EXPLAINED THEIR SITUATION. NO ONE WAS GUILTY OF ANYTHING.

GOLDENBANE: STOP! ENOUGH! 

SIR: ARE YOU THINKING THE SAME THING I AM THINKING?

GOLDENBANE: LOOK AT US! LOCKED IN A SEEMINGLY ENDLESS BATTLE WHILE BOTH OF OUR KINGDOMS FALL APART AROUND US BECAUSE OF OUR OWN DECISIONS! WE MUST SET ASIDE EVERY MEANINGLESS DISAGREEMENT AND UNIFY MORE THAN EVER.

DUKE: UNITY. PERHAPS IT IS POSSIBLE AFTER ALL.

ETHAN (AS HE LOWERS HIS SWORD): THERE HAS BEEN ENOUGH DEATH. JUST LIKE WE WERE THE ONES TO START THIS, WE ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN AND WILL END THIS. MY FRIENDS.

NARRATOR: AND SO, AFTER ALL THE CHAOS, THE OLD ALLIANCE WAS REBORN AND WAS NOW STRONGER THAN EVER. SIR COCKROACHSU III, DUKE OF FLIES, AND ETHAN KNIGHT PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS. NOW, UNDER THE GOLDEN STRIKES OF SUNLIGHT, THEY EMBRACED A HORIZON SATISFIED BY A VISION OF A UNITED FUTURE.
