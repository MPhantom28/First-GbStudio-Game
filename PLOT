ADVENTURES OF THE AQUATERRIAN KNIGHT

PROLOGUE:
THERE WAS ONCE A KINGDOM IN NORTHERN EUROPE THAT LIVED IN HARMONY. EVERYTHING HAD BEEN THIS WAY FOR CENTURIES. NEARLY ALL EVENTS UNFOLDED PEACEFULLY AND IN WAYS THAT BENEFITED EVERYONE INVOLVED. THE SUCCESS OF THIS SOCIETY HAD EVEN REACHED ALLIANCES WITH MANY OTHER CIVILIZATIONS (THIS WAS OUTSTANDING SINCE ONLY HUMANS WERE HERE, WHILE ALL THE OTHERS WERE HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL INSECTS). 


PLOT:
THIS WAS ALL UNTIL ONE NIGHT WHEN ONLY TIRED GUARDSMEN WERE LEFT TO SECURE ENTRY TO GOLDANOR'S TERRITORY, AN EVIL LITTLE ROACH NAMED ROACHIE BROKE IN THROUGH A SMALL CRACK IN THE WALL SURROUNDING. HE GATHERED INTEL ON THE MILITARY'S HEAVY TRAINING, THE QUIET ACQUISITION OF WEAPONRY, AND PLANS TO SEND MASSIVE HUMAN PRESENCE SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THEIR BORDERS. ROCHIE USED THIS INFORMATION TO CONVINCE HIS KING, SIR. COCKROACHUS III, THAT GOLDANOR WAS SECRETLY GOING TO BETRAY THEIR ALLIANCE AND CONQUER ALL THE INSECT KINGDOMS. (ROACHIE'S MOTIVE WAS THAT HE WANTED TO GET REVENGE ON THE KING BECAUSE YEARS AGO, HIS CONVOY HAD RUN OVER A SMALL INSECT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE HIS TEACHER, WHO TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING HE NEEDED TO KNOW TO SURVIVE OUT THERE). SIR COCKROACHES IMMEDIATELY SEND MESSENGERS TO GATHER ALL THE OTHER INSECT KINGS TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION. THEY EVENTUALLY AGREED ON WORKING TOGETHER AGAINST GOLDANOR. THEY ATTACKED GOLDANOR WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECTED IT. FAST FORWARD A FEW MONTHS AHEAD AND THE CONSTANT BATTLES AND WAR HAD EXHAUSTED ALL SIDES TO THE POINT WHERE THEY BEGAN RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS. THE ONLY REASON WHY GOLDANOR WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE AGAINST SO MANY FOR SO LONG WAS THE VERY LARGE SUPPLY OF ARMAMENTS AND MANPOWER, BUT EVEN THEN, RESOURCES WERE RUNNING OUT. THIS IS WHEN THE KING OF GOLDANOR, ALAN GOLDENBANE, REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD ONE SOLDIER IN PARTICULAR THAT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT. HIS NAME WAS ETHAN KNIGHT AND HE HAD MADE A GREAT NAME FOR HIMSELF FOR MANY YEARS. HE WAS THE GREATEST FIGHTER ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN AND THE ONLY WAY TO KILL HIM WAS BY FREEZING HIS HEART. THE OPPOSING ARMIES DID NOT HAVE ANY MEANS TO DO SUCH THING, SO KING ALAN SENT HIM. 

ONE DAY, AFTER MOTHS OF CHAOS AND UNNECESSARY SUFFERING, THE TWO ARMIES MET FACE TO FACE(ALL THE INSECTS' KINGDOM'S ARMIES COMBINED AGAINST GOLDANORS'), KING ALAN, WHO WAS ON THE FRONTLINES, SENT ETHAN TO FIGHT  AGAINST THE INSECTS' STRONGEST SOLDIER, INSECTICIDE. 


EPILOGUE:

ETHAN WALKED TOWARD THE INSECT ARMY, THE STONES ON THE GROUND JUMPED UP AND DOWN. HE REFUSED TO LOWER HIS SIGHT FROM THE FACES OF EVERY LEADER AND COMMANDER WITHIN THE INSECT ARMIES. SIR COCKROACHES AND THE DUKE OF FLIES ASKED FOR TWO SOLDIERS, ONE FROM EACH OF THEIR KINGDOMS, TO FIGHT ETHAN. NO ONE DARED TO EVEN CONSIDER DOING SO. TO AVOID SHOWING A LACK OF AUTHORITY AND POWER, THE TWO INSECT KINGS TOOK A FEW STEPS FORWARD AND DECIDED THAT THEY WOULD FIGHT ETHAN TOGETHER. 
AFTER A BRIEF BUT LEGENDARY CLASH BETWEEN ETHAN AND THE COMBINED MIGHT OF SIR COCKROACHUS AND THE DUKE OF FLIES, THE BATTLEFIELD FELL SILENT. AS THE DUST SETTLED AND THE COMBATANTS CAUGHT THEIR BREATH, A MOMENT OF REALIZATION DAWNED UPON THEM. IN THE FACE OF UNEXPEDTED ODDS, ETHAN'S SILENT MESSAGE OF PEACE HAD PREVAILED.

WITH WEARY HEARTS AND NEWFOUND RESPECT, SIR COCKROACHUS AND THE DUKE OF FLIES LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS. THEIR INITIAL HOSTILITY GAVE WAY TO A SHARED UNDERSTANDING, AND TOGETHER WITH ETHAN, THEY EMBRACED THE VISION OF A UNITED FUTURE. UNDER THE GOLDEN RAYS OF THE RISING SUN, THEIR DIFFERENCES SET ASIDE IN FAVOR OF COOPERATION.

IN THIS TURN OF EVENTS, THE LANDS OF NORTHERN EUROPE BORE WITNESS TO AN EVENT OF RECONCILIATION. AS THE ECHOES OF BATTLE FADED, THE PROMISE OF ALLIANCE AND PEACE ILLUMINATED THE HORIZON, CASTING ASIDE THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST AND HERALDING A FUTURE FILLED WITH BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITY.



NARRATOR (PROLOGUE BEFORE DIALOGUE FOR CONTEXT):

THERE WAS ONCE A KINGDOM IN NORTHERN EUROPE THAT LIVED IN HARMONY. EVERYTHING HAD BEEN THIS WAY FOR CENTURIES. NEARLY ALL EVENTS UNFOLDED PEACEFULLY AND IN WAYS THAT BENEFITED EVERYONE INVOLVED. THE SUCCESS OF THIS SOCIETY HAD EVEN REACHED ALLIANCES WITH MANY OTHER CIVILIZATIONS (THIS WAS OUTSTANDING SINCE ONLY HUMANS WERE HERE, WHILE ALL THE OTHERS WERE HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL INSECTS).



DIALOGUE:


KING GOLDENBANE: GOOD NIGHT MY DEAR KINGDOM!

GUARDS: HAVE AN OUTSTANDING NIGHT, YOUR MAJESTY.

ROACHIE (APPROACHING THE CRACK AND TALKING TO HIMSELF): YOU'VE ALMOST REACHED THE BEGINNING OF YOUR REVENGE, ROACHIE! JUST A LITTLE FURTHER.

GUARD 1: LONG DAY, AIN'T IT?

GUARD 2: SURELY MY FRIEND, ONE MORE NIGHT AND WE'RE ON OUR EARNED MONTH-LONG BREAK.

GUARD 1 (YAWNING): HARD TO GET USED TO.

(THE CITY NEVER RESTS, SO EVEN AT NIGHT, YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUNDS OF MERCHANTS, LOCKSMITHS, FARMERS, AND MANY OTHERS PREPARING FOR THE NEXT DAY)

(AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER, BOTH WERE KEPT AWAKE BY THE NOISE)

ROACHIE (HIS ANTENNAE HAD STARTED TWITCHING AS HE GOT CLOSER): ALMOST THERE! THESE HUMANS WILL PAY FOR KILLING MY MASTER!

(ROACHIE'S STEPS MAKE A CRUNCHY NOISE ON THE LEAVES)

GUARD 1: DID YOU HEAR THAT?

GUARD 2: PROBABLY JUST AN ANIMAL ROAMING AROUND. LET'S STAY AWAKE AND KEEP ALERT.

(ROACHIE FROZE AND HELD HIS BREATH FOR A FEW SECONDS)

ROACHIE: ALRIGHT, IN THROUGH THE WALL, COLLECT THE INTEL I NEED TO BRING GOLDANOR DOWN, AND OUT I AM.

SERVANT (PASSING BY): ANOTHER LATE NIGHT... I NEED TO SEE THE KIDS

ROACHIE (AS HE QUICKLY RUNS TO THE SHADOWS): I MUST NOT BE CAUGHT.

ROACHIE: ALMOST THERE.

(HERE, ROACHIE REACHES AN AIR DUCT IN THE CEILING AND FINDS THE TOP MILITARY COMMANDER SPEAKING WITH HIS PEOPLE, HE TAKES OUT HIS VERY TINY NOTE PAD AND WRITE EVERYTHING HE HEARS)

ROACHIE (AS HE LEAVES): THIS WILL CERTAINLY CONVINCE MY KING, SIR COCKROACHUS III, THAT GOLDANOR IS COMMITTING TREASON!
